Repository for Project 4 - Cohabitant Website

This is my submission for our fourth marked project in web development at Red Academy. Our goal is to replicate a blog based website using Angular where we pull blogs from a database and create the ability to post new blog entries to the same database, in turn updating the list of blog posts being displayed on the website. Our focus is to completely utilize Angular for component structure, and typescript to carry out all of our javascript functionality.
